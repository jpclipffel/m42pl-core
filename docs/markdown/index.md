# M42PL - A Data Processing Language

M42PL is a *data processing language*, inspired by Unix shells and [Splunk].

The language is designed to be as easy as possible to use, and to make common 
scripting and programming tasks even easier. It does not have a tedious syntax
to learn, and hides advanced programming concepts from the user.
